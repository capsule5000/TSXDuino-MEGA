# TSXDuino MEGA

This project is another version of the TSXDuino from @Edu_Arana, but in this case using the arduino MEGA microcontroller. Using the arduino microcontroller MEGA greatly expands the new future functions, which were limited to the arduino nano microcontroller. This project would not have been possible without the contribution of @rcmolina and @melinkv.

# Instructions

1- The PCB board is fully screen printed for easy assembly. It has under the OLED screen some pads to configure the positive (+) and negative (-) pins of the board OLED by means of a pair of solders.

2-TSXDuino MEGA can work with the power of the MSX cartridge slot or only the USB of the arduino MEGA. WARNING! Do not use both power simultaneously.

3-In the amplifier circuit, to reduce costs, they sell a PCB, see image (/ images / PAM8406), and all its components can be used

4-Download the Maxduino Firmware (MaxDuino_1.30M) adapted for arduino MEGA from MELINKV at the following link https://github.com/merlinkv

5- TSXDuino has an on / off selector(MUTE) to activate the audio through the speaker to listen to the file.

6- It also has a second on / off selector to activate the output amplifier to the computer.

7- It has 6 buttons (up, down, play, stop, root and del) to navigate through the menus of the maxduino version MEGA

8- TSXDuino has two potentiometers that regulate the output audio and speaker audio separately.

# Note

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
