# TSXDuino MEGA

This project is another version of the TSXDuino from @Edu_Arana, but in this case using the MEGA arduino microcontroller. Using the arduino microcontroller MEGA greatly expands the new future functions, which were limited to the arduino nano microcontroller. This project would not have been possible without the contribution of @rcmolina and @melinkv.

# Instructions

1- The PCB board is fully screen printed for easy assembly. It has under the OLED screen some pads to configure the positive (+) and negative (-) pins of the board by means of a pair of solders.

2-Download the Maxduino Firmware (MaxDuino_1.30M) adapted for arduino MEGA from MELINKV at the following link https://github.com/merlinkv

3- TSXDuino has an on / off selector to activate the audio through the speaker to listen to the file.

4- It also has a second on / off selector to activate the output amplifier to the computer.

5- TSXDuino has two potentiometers that regulate the output audio and speaker audio separately.
